    - Motivation:
         - Inspired by recent progress in object retrieval, some researchers present a recurrent neural network able to localize an object in an image by means of a natural language query only, either returning a bounding box or a free-form segment.

    - Key points:
         - In the first query frame (t = 0), all three models rely on the Lingual Specification Network to identify the target. An LSTM scans the text query and feeds a dynamic filter generation layer that produces novel visual filters to convolve the frameâ€™s feature map. In the following frames:
              -  1) Model I tracks the target by lingual specification only, independently applying the Lingual Specification Network on all frames.
              -  2) Model II takes the visual patch corresponding to the target identified from the first frame as input to the Visual Specification Network, which employs a CNN to dynamically generate the visual filters and convolves an input frame with the filters. 
              -  3) Model III relies jointly on the lingual and visual specification. The visual specification utilizes the Visual Specification Network, while the lingual specification utilizes the Lingual Specification Attention Network, including an attention model that selectively focuses on parts of the lingual description.

    - Performance:
         - 63.2 AP on COCO val2017 with a SiwnL backbone
         - 63.3 AP on test-dev
